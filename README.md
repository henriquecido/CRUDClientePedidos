# ClientMenu

## About

CRUD done in Java by the Client and his Order. I was based on a cafeteria close to home, whose name is Skina Lanches, I added a mini-menu for the user.

Some error treatments, but not all possible.

Until now,

The program is without front, but soon I will add, its visualization will be through the console of your preference.
